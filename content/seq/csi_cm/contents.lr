body:

Removes `amount` lines from the current cursor row down. The remaining lines to the bottom margin are shifted up and space from the bottom margin up is filled with empty lines.

{{snip('unset-pending-wrap')}}

If the current cursor position is outside of the [current scroll region](/scrolling-region) it does nothing.

If `amount` is greater than the remaining number of lines in the scrolling region it is adjusted down.

In {{mode_link('p69')}} mode the margins are respected; lines are only scrolled in the scroll region.

If the cell movement splits a multi cell character that character cleared, by replacing it by spaces, keeping its current attributes.

All other cleared space is colored according to the current [SGR state](/attr).

Moves the cursor to the left margin.
