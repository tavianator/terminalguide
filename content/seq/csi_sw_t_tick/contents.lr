title: DEC Locator Watch Pointer Leave
---
body:

DEC locator watch pointer location.

If the current mouse reporting mode is not DEC locator this sequence does nothing.

If the pointer is outside of the terminal window:
* and all parameters are 0:
 * Watch for the pointer to reenter the window. If the DEC locator is still active when that happens reports an event of type 10.
* and some parameter is not 0:
 * Immediately reports an event of type 0.

Otherwise:

Adjust all parameters that are 0 to the current pointer position (i.e. left and right to the current x coordinate of the pointer and top and bottom to the current y coordinate of the pointer).

If `top` > `bottom` swap the values of `top` and `bottom`. If `left` > `right` swap the values of `left` and `right`.

If the pointer is outside the rectangle described by `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right` (all inclusive) the terminal reports an event of type 10.

Otherwise the terminal watches the pointer and reports and an event of type 10 when the pointer leaves the rectangle.

All events reported because of this sequence count for the single shot mode.

See {{seq_link('csi_sz_t_tick')}} for details about the possible reports.
