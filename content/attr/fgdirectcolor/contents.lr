body:

urxvt supports only form 4.

urxvt uses a set of dynamic color slots and overwrites the least recently used in the proximity of the target color. Real usage should yield much better result than the demonstration color ramps.

body:

{{info}} vte supports forms 1 and 4.
{{miss}} Form 2 is supported when the color space id is empty (defaulted). Any digit in the color space id prevents this form from working (subparameters are still consumed)
{{info}} Form 2 with any color space was accepted before version 0.42.

{{info}} linuxvc only supports form 4.
{{miss}} linuxvc approximates from an 8 or 16 color palette, by extracting a hue and brightness and selecting one of the 8 named colors and an intensity from that. See {{sgr_link('2')}} and {{sgr_link('fgcol8bright')}} for how intensity is rendered depending on configuration.
