body:

{{info}} linuxvc uses a unified intensity model where faint uses intensity 0. Intensity is shared with {{sgr_link('1')}} and {{sgr_link('fgcol8bright')}}. Reset value for intensity is 1.
{{info}} faint colors always render as grey (or as the color setup via {{seq_link('csi_x5D_square_bracket')}}).
{{miss}} The default setting of faint only works with vgacon when using a 256 glyph font. When using a 512 glyph font with vgacon the default setup for faint renders as black.
